# Analyzing MSBuild Failures with Binary Logs

Use MSBuild's built-in **binlog replay** to convert binary logs into searchable text logs, then analyze with standard tools (`grep`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `find`).

## Build Error Investigation (Primary Workflow)

### Step 1: Replay the binlog to text logs

Replay produces multiple focused log files in one pass:

```bash
dotnet msbuild build.binlog -noconlog \
  -fl  -flp:v=diag;logfile=full.log;performancesummary \
  -fl1 -flp1:errorsonly;logfile=errors.log \
  -fl2 -flp2:warningsonly;logfile=warnings.log
```

> **PowerShell note:** Use `-flp:"v=diag;logfile=full.log;performancesummary"` (quoted semicolons).

### Step 2: Read the errors

```bash
cat errors.log
```

This gives all errors with file paths, line numbers, error codes, and project context.

### Step 3: Search for context around specific errors

```bash
# Find all occurrences of a specific error code with surrounding context
grep -n -B2 -A2 "CS0246" full.log

# Find which projects failed to compile
grep -i "CoreCompile.*FAILED\|Build FAILED\|error MSB" full.log

# Find project build order and results
grep "done building project\|Building with" full.log | head -50
```

### Step 4: Detect cascading failures

Projects that never reached `CoreCompile` failed because a dependency failed, not their own code:

```bash
# List all projects that ran CoreCompile
grep 'Target "CoreCompile"' full.log | grep -oP 'project "[^"]*"'

# Compare against projects that had errors to identify cascading failures
grep "project.*FAILED" full.log
```

### Step 5: Examine project files for root causes

```bash
# Read the .csproj of the failing project
cat path/to/Services/Services.csproj

# Check PackageReference and ProjectReference entries
grep -n "PackageReference\|ProjectReference" path/to/Services/Services.csproj
```

**Write your diagnosis as soon as you have enough information.** Do not over-investigate.

## Additional Workflows

### Performance Investigation
```bash
# The PerformanceSummary is at the end of full.log
tail -100 full.log   # shows target/task timing summary
grep "Target Performance Summary\|Task Performance Summary" -A 50 full.log
```

### Dependency/Evaluation Issues
```bash
# Check evaluation properties
grep -i "OutputPath\|IntermediateOutputPath\|TargetFramework" full.log | head -30
# Check item groups
grep "PackageReference\|ProjectReference" full.log | head -30
```

## Replay reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `dotnet msbuild X.binlog -noconlog -fl -flp:v=diag;logfile=full.log;performancesummary` | Full diagnostic log with perf summary |
| `dotnet msbuild X.binlog -noconlog -fl -flp:errorsonly;logfile=errors.log` | Errors only |
| `dotnet msbuild X.binlog -noconlog -fl -flp:warningsonly;logfile=warnings.log` | Warnings only |
| `grep -n "PATTERN" full.log` | Search for patterns in the replayed log |
| `dotnet msbuild -pp:preprocessed.xml Proj.csproj` | Preprocess — inline all imports into one file |

## Generating a binlog (only if none exists)

```bash
dotnet build /bl:build.binlog
```

## Common error patterns

1. **CS0246 / "type not found"** → Missing PackageReference — check the .csproj
2. **MSB4019 / "imported project not found"** → SDK install or global.json issue
3. **NU1605 / "package downgrade"** → Version conflict in package graph
4. **MSB3277 / "version conflicts"** → Binding redirect or version alignment issue
5. **Project failed at ResolveProjectReferences** → Cascading failure from a dependency
