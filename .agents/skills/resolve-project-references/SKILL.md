# Misleading ResolveProjectReferences Time

Prevent misguided optimization of `ResolveProjectReferences` by explaining that its reported time is wall-clock wait time, not CPU work.

## When to Use

- `ResolveProjectReferences` appears as the most expensive target in the Target Performance Summary
- A developer is trying to optimize `ResolveProjectReferences` directly
- Build performance analysis shows a single target consuming 50-80% of total build time

## When Not to Use

- General build performance optimization (use `build-perf-diagnostics` instead)
- The bottleneck is clearly a different target (e.g., `Csc`, `ResolveAssemblyReference`)
- The user has not yet captured a binlog or performance summary

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Build log or binlog | Yes | A diagnostic build log or binlog containing the Target Performance Summary |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Confirm the misleading symptom

Verify that `ResolveProjectReferences` appears as the top target in the **Target** Performance Summary. This is the misleading metric.

### Step 2: Explain why it is misleading

The reported time includes **waiting for dependent projects to build** while the MSBuild node is yielded (see dotnet/msbuild#3135). During this wait, the node may be doing useful work on other projects. The target itself does very little work.

### Step 3: Redirect to task self-time

Guide the user to use the **Task** Performance Summary instead:

```bash
dotnet msbuild build.binlog -noconlog -fl "-flp:v=diag;logfile=full.log;performancesummary"
grep "Task Performance Summary" -A 50 full.log
```

Focus on self-time of actual tasks:

- **Csc**: see `build-perf-diagnostics` skill (Section 2: Roslyn Analyzers)
- **ResolveAssemblyReference**: see `build-perf-diagnostics` skill (Section 1: RAR)
- **Copy**: see `build-perf-diagnostics` skill (Section 4: File I/O)
- **Serialization bottlenecks**: see `build-parallelism` skill

## Validation

- [ ] Task Performance Summary was used instead of Target Performance Summary
- [ ] `ResolveProjectReferences` was not set as the optimization target
- [ ] A concrete task (e.g., `Csc`, `Copy`, `ResolveAssemblyReference`) was identified as the true bottleneck
